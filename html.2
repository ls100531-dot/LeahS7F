    <title>How to write a poem/song </title>
</head>
<body>
<ul> 
<li>To write a poem it is very similar to writing a song they both have to be rythmic and always could either need some rhyming words or repition each of them would benefit if they in could simple or very compilcated words <br>
it usally depends what type of poem or song you would like to write .
<li> Writing poem can take you a long time or short time depending on what you are writiing about and your writing speed i personally like to write poems from image prompts image prompt are harder to find but they can inspire you more than a simple lousey word .
<li> To write a song you need your topic and then a meldoy and beat then the lyric writing can begin but you can also write some lyrics to then write the music but writing music is ussally easier for me .
<ul/>
<h2> Poem structures and vocabulary <h2/>
   <p> The structure of a poem can make little to no sense the words can be made up but if they are make sure they are described somewhere either to  your publisher or on your website if you have one poem need to make sense in a way but if you cant explain it <br>
then you need to change it . Poems ussally have a certain type of structure to show what the person or thing are going through . The stanzas in your poem can change in size and type of vocabular in it shown in  the poem island man the stanzas change from very tropical <br>
and lush vocabulary in it to some of the other stanzas with very metallic and  robtic voabulary .
